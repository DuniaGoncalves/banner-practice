## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML

This is one of the first sites I put together. It is mainly a practice of putting together the HTML I learned.  While putting this together I made sure that I made sound choices to have my code be systematically correct.

## Lessons Learned:

Organization and tidiness  is very important when you want to write dry and clean code.
